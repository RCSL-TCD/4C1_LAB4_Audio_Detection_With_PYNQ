        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For this lab, we will explore how to deploy a Quantised Neural Network(QNN) on our FPGAs to finish a keyword spotting (KWS).\n",

        "We will finish this task with:\n",
        "- Dataset: Google Speech V2 (preprocessed version, 12 classes, MFCC feature extracted)\n",
        "- Model:   QMLP (3bits)\n",

        "- Lab5 A: Train a quantised model and find out the difference between the float NN and the QNN.\n",
        "- Lab5 B (optional): Export the quantised model into a hardware design which could be excuted on our PYNQ board.\n",
        "- Lab5 C: Excute the model in the jupyter notebook to benchmark its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Note\n",
        "We do encourage you to finish this lab in a FINN docker enviroment, but considering limited time, you could also try this in a normal conda/python/colab enviroment.\n",

        "In Lab5B, to generate your own DNN IP, it must be done in the FINN docker.
