        "We will finish this task with:\n",
        "- Dataset: Google Speech V2 (preprocessed version, 12 classes, MFCC feature extracted)\n",

        "- Lab5 A: Train a quantised model and find out the difference between the float NN and the QNN.\n",
        "- Lab5 B (optional): Export the quantised model into a hardware design which could be excuted on our PYNQ board.\n",
        "- Lab5 C: Excute the model in the jupyter notebook to benchmark its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Note\n",
        "We do encourage you to finish this lab in a FINN docker enviroment, but considering limited time, you could also try this in a normal conda/python/colab enviroment.\n",
